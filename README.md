# Syte2 for Zeit Now v2

Syte2 is the new and refined version of [Syte](http://github.com/rigoneri/syte), a personal website with interactive social integrations. Syte2 integrates with Twitter, Instagram, Foursquare, Github, Dribbble, Spotify/Last.fm, YouTube and Tumblr. You can see it in action on [the creator's personal site](http://rigoneri.com).

## For Zeit Now v2

Minor modifications to run the server using the Now 2.0 serverless enviornment. Moved the controllers to an API folder and got rid of Express routing and moved it into now.json.
